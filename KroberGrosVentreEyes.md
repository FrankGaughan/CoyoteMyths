11. NIX'ANT LOSES HIS EYES. 

Nix'ant met a Bird that was sending its eyes into a tree. Then he cried, and begged the Bird, until at last it gave him the power. It told him, "You must do this only when it is necessary." Nix'ant went off. He tried his new power, and his eyes successfully left him and returned to him. After a time they remained in a tree. He could not get them back. Then he cried. A Mouse came to him, and Nix'ant asked it to lend him its eyes. The Mouse lent him its eyes, and Nix'ant was able to find his own. But his own eyes had already shriveled on the tree. He soaked them in water until they swelled. Then he put them back in his head.
