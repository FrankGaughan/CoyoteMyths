Raven said that he didn’t want death in this world. “I’ll throw a stick in the river. If it sinks there is going to be death, but if not, everything will be all right,” he said. 

Then Coyote came along and said, “I’ll throw a rock in the river. If it sinks people will die. If it doesn’t’ sink there will be no death.” 

Raven threw the sticks and they floated off. Then Coyote threw the rock and it sank. After that people began to die off.
