He Becomes Blind

As he continued his endless journey, he heard someone calling for his eyes, and he came upon a medicine man who threw his eyes into the air, shook his staff at them, and called upon them to return. Wisagatchak, of course, was anxious to acquire this power, and asked, "Why do you do that?" "That is the way I treat them when they7 are sore," was the reply of the magician, who readily divulged the secret to Wisagatchak. He was cautioned not to attempt the feat unless his eyes really needed treatment. He soon forgot the warning and exercised his new power with success. " That is my trick now," said he laughing to himself. Pretending that his eyes were sore he again cast them from him, but instead of returning the eyes fell far beyond his reach. As he crept about on his hands and knees searching for them, he was discovered by a fox which caught up a stick and thrust the end into the empty eye-sockets of helpless Wisagatchak, causing him to cry out with the pain. 

The fox was delighted with its success and tried again, but the manito succeeded in catching it.
"Now, I will kill you," said he. 
" Why do you not keep me, and I will lead you about?" asked the fox. Seeing the wisdom of this, he spared the life of the fox and continued his journey holding to its tail. Wisagatchak soon tired of that manner of traveling and told the fox to bring him some clear spruce gum. When he obtained this, he shaped two pieces for eyes; after rubbing them a few times he was able to see a little. Again he rubbed until his sight was wholly restored. He then released the fox, saying, "Now, make your own living." 

The fox ran off and soon fell asleep upon a grassy point which projected into the lake. Wisagatchak fired the grass and the fox perished in the flames.
